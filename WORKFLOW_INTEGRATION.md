# Two-Framework Workflow: Context Engineering → Implementation Execution

## 🔄 Complete Autonomous Development Pipeline

This guide shows how to use both frameworks together to achieve **99% autonomous software development** from initial idea to deployed product.

## 📋 Overview: The Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Perfect Specification Creation
**Framework**: Autonomous Context Engineering Framework  
**Duration**: 1-8 weeks (depending on project complexity)  
**Output**: Perfect specifications with zero ambiguity  
**Goal**: Eliminate all implementation decisions through comprehensive research and planning

### Phase 2: Mechanical Implementation
**Framework**: Autonomous Implementation Execution Framework  
**Duration**: 2 days - 4 weeks (predictable from Phase 1 task breakdown)  
**Output**: Fully functional software product  
**Goal**: Build exactly what was specified with zero creative decisions

## 🚀 Complete Workflow Guide

### Step 1: Context Engineering Phase (Framework 1)
