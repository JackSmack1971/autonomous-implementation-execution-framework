# Implementation Execution Quick Start

## 🚀 From Context to Code in 10 Minutes

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] **Context Engineering Complete**: Your project has completed context engineering
- [ ] **Context Folder Available**: You have the `context-engineering/` folder from the Context Engineering Framework
- [ ] **VS Code Setup**: VS Code with Roo Code extension installed and configured
- [ ] **Project Directory**: Empty directory ready for your new project implementation

## Step-by-Step Implementation Launch

### Step 1: Project Setup (2 minutes)
1. **Create New Project Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-awesome-project
   cd my-awesome-project
   ```

2. **Copy Context Engineering Folder**
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire context-engineering folder to your project root
   cp -r /path/to/context-engineering-project/context-engineering ./
   ```

3. **Copy Implementation Framework Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the .roo folder from this framework
   cp -r /path/to/autonomous-implementation-execution-framework/.roo ./
   ```

4. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### Step 2: Verification (1 minute)
- [ ] **Context Folder Exists**: Verify `context-engineering/` folder is in project root
- [ ] **Roo Modes Loaded**: Open Roo Code panel and confirm 12 implementation modes are available
- [ ] **Context Status Check**: Verify context documents show ✅ Complete status

### Step 3: Implementation Launch (2 minutes)
1. **Switch to Implementation Orchestrator**
   - Open Roo Code panel
   - Select **⚙️ Implementation Orchestrator** mode

2. **Start Implementation**
   ```
   Prompt: "Begin implementation execution following the context-engineering specifications. Read the implementation guide and start with Phase 1 infrastructure setup."
   ```

3. **Let Orchestrator Coordinate**
   - Implementation Orchestrator will read all context specifications
   - It will create an execution plan based on task-breakdown.md
   - It will delegate to appropriate specialist modes

### Step 4: Follow the Systematic Implementation (Ongoing)
The Implementation Orchestrator will guide you through these phases:

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- **Database Implementation Specialist** → Create schema per database-schema-detailed.md
- **DevOps Implementation Specialist** → Setup CI/CD per deployment-architecture.md
- **Backend Implementation Specialist** → Create base API structure

#### Phase 2: Core Backend
- **API Endpoint Builder** → Implement authentication endpoints
- **Backend Implementation Specialist** → Build business logic services
- **Integration Implementation Specialist** → Connect external services
- **Testing Implementation Specialist** → Create backend tests

#### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- **UI Component Builder** → Create reusable components
- **Frontend Implementation Specialist** → Build pages and routing
- **Testing Implementation Specialist** → Create frontend tests

#### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- **QA Validator** → Validate all acceptance criteria
- **Performance Validator** → Validate performance requirements
- **Security Validator** → Validate security requirements

## 🚨 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Context specifications unclear"
**Fix**: 
1. Search context-engineering/ folder for more details
2. Create boomerang task for Context Engineering team
3. Never make assumptions - wait for clarification

### Issue: "Implementation mode making creative decisions"  
**Fix**:
1. Remind mode to follow context specifications exactly
2. Reference specific context document that contains the decision
3. Use phrase: "Follow the context-engineering specifications exactly"

### Issue: "Quality gates failing"
**Fix**:
1. Review validation-criteria.md for specific requirements
2. Check that implementation matches context specifications exactly
3. Run validation again after fixing compliance issues

### Issue: "Context documents show 🔄 Pending status"
**Fix**:
1. Return to Context Engineering Framework
2. Complete the pending specifications  
3. Copy updated context-engineering/ folder to implementation project
