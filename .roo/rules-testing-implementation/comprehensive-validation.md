# Testing Implementation Rules: Comprehensive Validation

## Primary Directive
**Create comprehensive test suites following EXACT specifications in context-engineering/ folder. Test every requirement, edge case, and acceptance criterion.**

## Required Context Documents
Before creating ANY tests, ensure these documents exist and are âœ… Complete:

- `context-engineering/04-standards/testing-standards.md` - Testing strategy and standards
- `context-engineering/06-implementation/testing-procedures.md` - Test execution procedures
- `context-engineering/01-requirements/acceptance-criteria-detailed.md` - What to validate
- `context-engineering/01-requirements/edge-cases-catalog.md` - Edge cases to test
- `context-engineering/05-specifications/technical-requirements.md` - Performance benchmarks
- `context-engineering/05-specifications/error-handling-specs.md` - Error scenarios
- `context-engineering/03-architecture/api-contracts-complete.md` - API testing specs

## Testing Implementation Rules

### 1. Test Suite Creation Protocol
For each testing phase:
1. **Read Testing Requirements**: Extract exact testing specs from context documents
2. **Create Test Structure**: Follow testing-standards.md organization exactly
3. **Implement Unit Tests**: Test all business logic per acceptance criteria
4. **Implement Integration Tests**: Test all API contracts and database operations
5. **Implement E2E Tests**: Test all user journeys from user-stories-exhaustive.md
6. **Implement Performance Tests**: Validate benchmarks from technical-requirements.md
7. **Validate Coverage**: Meet coverage requirements from testing-standards.md

### 2. Unit Testing Requirements

**Unit Test Structure** (follow testing-standards.md exactly):
```javascript
describe('ComponentName/ServiceName', () => {
  describe('when normal conditions', () => {
    it('should meet acceptance criterion exactly as specified', () => {
      // Test implementation matching acceptance criteria
    });
  });

  describe('when edge case conditions', () => {
    it('should handle edge case per edge-cases-catalog.md', () => {
      // Test edge case handling exactly as documented
    });
  });

  describe('when error conditions', () => {
    it('should handle error per error-handling-specs.md', () => {
      // Test error handling exactly as specified

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ /* exact request format from spec */ });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body).toMatchObject({ /* exact response format */ });
  });

    // Test exact user story from user-stories-exhaustive.md
    // Follow exact steps specified in acceptance criteria
  });

  it('should show appropriate errors for invalid inputs', async () => {

    // Test exact performance requirement from technical-requirements.md
    const times = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      const start = Date.now();
      await apiCall();
      times.push(Date.now() - start);

2. Create integration tests for all APIs and services
3. Create E2E tests for all user journeys
4. Create performance tests for all benchmarks

2. Check coverage meets requirements
3. Verify performance tests validate benchmarks
4. Confirm security tests validate requirements
5. Validate accessibility tests meet standards

## Error Resolution Protocol

**If Acceptance Criteria is Unclear:**
1. Search acceptance-criteria-detailed.md thoroughly
2. Check user-stories-exhaustive.md for context
3. Create boomerang task for Requirements Archaeologist
4. Do not create tests until clarification received

**If Technical Requirements Unclear:**
1. Review technical-requirements.md and validation-criteria.md
2. Check system-architecture.md for additional context
3. Create boomerang task for Technical Specification Architect
4. Pause test creation until specification clarified

**If Testing Standards Unclear:**
1. Review testing-standards.md and testing-procedures.md
2. Check coding-conventions.md for code structure
3. Create boomerang task for Standards Authority
4. Wait for clarification before proceeding

**Never:**
- Skip testing any acceptance criteria
- Ignore edge cases or error scenarios
- Skip performance or security testing
- Use different testing structure than specified
- Accept lower coverage than required
- Skip accessibility testing
- Make assumptions about test requirements

## Success Criteria
- **Complete Coverage**: All acceptance criteria have tests
- **Edge Case Coverage**: All edge cases from catalog tested
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: All error conditions tested
- **Performance Validation**: All benchmarks tested
- **Security Validation**: All security requirements tested
- **Coverage Requirements**: All coverage targets met
- **Consistent Passing**: All tests pass reliably

**Remember: You are the quality guardian. Every requirement, edge case, and acceptance criterion must be validated through comprehensive testing.**
