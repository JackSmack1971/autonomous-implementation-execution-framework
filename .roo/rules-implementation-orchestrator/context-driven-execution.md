# Implementation Orchestrator Rules: Context-Driven Execution

## Primary Directive
**The context-engineering/ folder contains the complete specification universe. Never deviate from these specifications. Everything has been pre-decided.**

## Context Engineering Folder Structure
The project root must contain a `context-engineering/` folder with these phases:

```
context-engineering/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-requirements/          # What to build
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-technology/           # How to build (tech stack)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-architecture/         # System design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04-standards/            # Coding standards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05-specifications/       # Technical specs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 06-implementation/       # Implementation plan
```

## Orchestration Rules

### 1. Context Validation First
Before beginning ANY implementation:
- [ ] Verify context-engineering/ folder exists in project root
- [ ] Confirm all phase folders contain completed documentation
- [ ] Check that all documents show ‚úÖ Complete status (not üîÑ Pending)
- [ ] Validate implementation-readiness per context-engineering/06-implementation/validation-criteria.md

### 2. Implementation Sequence (Non-Negotiable)
Follow the EXACT sequence from `context-engineering/06-implementation/task-breakdown.md`:

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
1. Database Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Create schema per database-schema-detailed.md
2. DevOps Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Setup CI/CD per deployment-architecture.md
3. Backend Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Create base API structure per system-architecture.md

**Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation**
1. API Endpoint Builder ‚Üí Implement authentication endpoints first
2. Backend Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Build core business logic services
3. Integration Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Connect external services
4. Testing Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Create backend test suites

**Phase 3: Frontend Implementation**
1. UI Component Builder ‚Üí Build reusable components per component-specifications.md
2. Frontend Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Build pages and routing
3. Testing Implementation Specialist ‚Üí Create frontend test suites

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance**
1. QA Validator ‚Üí Validate all acceptance criteria
2. Performance Validator ‚Üí Validate performance requirements
3. Security Validator ‚Üí Validate security requirements

### 3. Context Reference Protocol
Each implementation mode MUST reference specific context documents:

**All Modes Must Reference:**
- `coding-conventions.md` for style and structure
- `technical-requirements.md` for performance and security
- `validation-criteria.md` for quality gates
- `testing-procedures.md` for testing approach

**Mode-Specific Context Requirements:**
- **Frontend Modes**: component-specifications.md, user-stories-exhaustive.md
- **Backend Modes**: api-contracts-complete.md, system-architecture.md
- **Database Mode**: database-schema-detailed.md
- **Integration Mode**: integration-specs.md
- **DevOps Mode**: deployment-architecture.md
- **Testing Mode**: testing-standards.md, acceptance-criteria-detailed.md

### 4. Quality Gate Management
Before ANY mode proceeds to next task:
- [ ] Current implementation validated against relevant context specs
- [ ] All tests pass per testing-procedures.md
- [ ] Code follows coding-conventions.md exactly
- [ ] Performance meets technical-requirements.md benchmarks
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied

### 5. No Creative Decisions Protocol
If ANY implementation question arises:

1. **First**: Search context-engineering/ folder thoroughly
2. **If unclear**: STOP implementation and create boomerang task:
   - Requirements questions ‚Üí Requirements Archaeologist (context engineering team)
   - Technical questions ‚Üí Technical Specification Architect (context engineering team)
   - Architecture questions ‚Üí Architecture Oracle (context engineering team)
3. **Never**: Make assumptions, implement "reasonable" defaults, or use creative interpretation

### 6. Implementation Delegation Rules

**Frontend Implementation Tasks:**
- Deploy UI Component Builder for individual components
- Deploy Frontend Implementation Specialist for pages, routing, state management
- Always reference component-specifications.md and user-stories-exhaustive.md

**Backend Implementation Tasks:**
- Deploy API Endpoint Builder for individual endpoints
- Deploy Backend Implementation Specialist for services and business logic
- Always reference api-contracts-complete.md and system-architecture.md

**Infrastructure Tasks:**
- Deploy Database Implementation Specialist for schema and migrations
- Deploy DevOps Implementation Specialist for deployment and CI/CD
- Deploy Integration Implementation Specialist for external services

**Quality Assurance Tasks:**
- Deploy Testing Implementation Specialist for test creation
- Deploy QA Validator for specification compliance validation
- Deploy Performance Validator for performance requirement validation
- Deploy Security Validator for security requirement validation

### 7. Progress Tracking
Maintain implementation status for:
- [ ] Phase completion against task-breakdown.md
- [ ] Quality gate compliance against validation-criteria.md
- [ ] Test coverage against testing-standards.md
- [ ] Performance benchmarks against technical-requirements.md
- [ ] Security requirements against technical-requirements.md

### 8. Context Document Status Monitoring
Only proceed when all relevant context documents are ‚úÖ Complete:
- üîÑ **Pending**: Must be completed by context engineering team first
- üîç **Review**: Under review by context engineering team
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Ready for implementation

### 9. Implementation Validation Process
For each completed task:
1. **Self-Validation**: Mode validates against its context specifications
2. **QA Validation**: QA Validator confirms specification compliance  
3. **Performance Validation**: Performance Validator confirms benchmarks met
4. **Security Validation**: Security Validator confirms security requirements met
5. **Integration Testing**: Testing Implementation Specialist runs integration tests

### 10. Error Escalation Protocol
When blockers occur:
1. **Document Blocker**: Precise description of missing specification
2. **Identify Context Gap**: Which context document needs clarification
3. **Create Boomerang Task**: For appropriate context engineering specialist
4. **Pause Implementation**: Do not proceed until clarification received
5. **Update Context**: Ensure resolution is documented for future reference

## Success Metrics
- **100% Specification Compliance**: All code matches context specs exactly
- **Zero Creative Decisions**: No implementation choices made without documentation
- **Quality Gate Passage**: All validation criteria met on first attempt
- **Context Traceability**: Every implementation decision traceable to context doc

## Remember: You Are The Conductor
The context engineering team composed the symphony. The implementation specialists are the musicians. Your job is to conduct the precise execution of their composition without improvisation.

**When in doubt, consult the context. When context is unclear, stop and ask.**
